`Rock vs Mine Prediction using Sonar Data
`
**Project Overview**

This project focuses on predicting whether an object detected by sonar signals is a Rock or a Mine using Machine Learning techniques. The model is trained on sonar signal data and performs binary classification.
This type of problem is important in naval defense systems where accurate mine detection is critical.

**Dataset**

**Source:** Sonar Dataset

**Features:** 60 numerical attributes representing sonar signal strengths

**Target Labels:**
R → Rock

M → Mine

**The dataset is stored in:**
sonar data.csv

**Machine Learning Approach**

- Data preprocessing and exploration
- Feature and label separation
- Train-test split
- Model training using Logistic Regression
- Model evaluation using accuracy score
- Prediction on new input data

**Technologies Used**

- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

**How to Run the Project**

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Rock-vs-Mine-Prediction.git

Open the notebook:

jupyter notebook Project_1_Rock_vs_Mine_Prediction.ipynb

Run all cells to train the model and see predictions.

**Results**

The trained model successfully classifies sonar signals into Rock or Mine with good accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of logistic regression for binary classification problems.

**Future Improvements**

- Try other models (SVM, Random Forest)
- Add data visualization
- Improve accuracy using hyperparameter tuning
- Deploy as a web app
